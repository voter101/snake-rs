- Solve issue with UTF-8. I was not able to print the border with `â–ˆ`, so I used spaces, which is probably not optimal. Lines are usually taller rather than wider, which causes weird looking top and bottom borders.
- Proper Game Over screen instead of `panic!`
- Show FPS counter as an option
- Starting menu
- Different maps, e.g. with no overlapping map (walls)
- Local leaderboard
- Update README with a GIF showcasing the game

Weird:

- Support for Nerdfont? (fallback required)
- Port to Playdate
- Option to speed-up on demand by holding a key
