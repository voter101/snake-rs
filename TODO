- FPS counter
- Various speeds
- React to changing window size
- Halt game when terminal size is too small
- Solve issue with UTF-8. I was not able to print the border with `â–ˆ`, so I used spaces, which is probably not optimal. Lines are usually taller rather than wider, which causes weird looking top and bottom borders.
- Proper Game Over screen instead of `panic!`
- Handle tight turns by queueing(?) the inputs (e.g. quick 180 degree change with `Right` -> `Down`)
  - How did the original handle it? It feels like they do 2-element queue there
- Starting menu
- Menu in the game
- Different maps, e.g. with no overlapping map
- Leaderboard
- Time based events
- Update README with a GIF

Weird:

- Support for Nerdfont? (fallback required)
- Port to Playdate
