# Snake.rs - Snake implementation in Rust

A simple toy game I wrote while learning Rust.

## Play the game

Run the game with:

```sh
cargo run
```

To turn off the game, you need to press `ESC` and then on pause menu press `q`.

## Configuration

To configure the game, you can pull the help message with:

```sh
cargo run -- --help
```
